Laravel is a comprehensive framework with a wide range of classes and functions. Showing the functions for each class would be extensive, but I can provide a brief overview of some of the essential functions available in some of the core classes:

1. **Routing (`Illuminate\Routing`)**:

    - `Route::get()`: Define a GET route.
    - `Route::post()`: Define a POST route.
    - `Route::put()`: Define a PUT route.
    - `Route::delete()`: Define a DELETE route.
    - `Route::any()`: Define a route that responds to any HTTP method.
    - `Route::match()`: Define a route that responds to specific HTTP methods.
    - `Route::group()`: Group routes with common attributes.

2. **Controllers (`Illuminate\Routing\Controller`)**:

    - Controller classes typically contain methods that handle specific routes (actions).

3. **Views (`Illuminate\View\View`)**:

    - `view()`: Load a view and pass data to it.
    - Blade templating engine: Allows you to use `@if`, `@foreach`, `@section`, `@yield`, and more.

4. **Models and Eloquent ORM (`Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model`)**:

    - `find()`: Find a record by primary key.
    - `all()`: Retrieve all records from the table.
    - `create()`: Create a new record in the table.
    - `update()`: Update existing records.
    - `delete()`: Delete records.
    - Relationships: `hasOne()`, `hasMany()`, `belongsTo()`, `belongsToMany()` for defining model relationships.

5. **Requests (`Illuminate\Http\Request`)**:

    - `$request->input()`: Retrieve form input data.
    - `$request->all()`: Get all input data.
    - `$request->query()`: Get query parameters.
    - `$request->file()`: Access uploaded files.

6. **Validation (`Illuminate\Support\Facades\Validator`)**:

    - `Validator::make()`: Create a new validator instance.
    - `validate()`: Validate incoming request data.

7. **Database Query Builder (`Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder`)**:

    - `select()`: Specify columns to be selected.
    - `where()`: Add conditions to the query.
    - `orderBy()`: Sort the results.
    - `join()`: Perform database joins.
    - `insert()`: Insert records.
    - `update()`: Update records.
    - `delete()`: Delete records.

8. **Migrations (`Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration`)**:

    - `up()`: Define the actions to run when migrating.
    - `down()`: Define the actions to run when rolling back a migration.

9. **Authentication (`Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth`)**:
    - `Auth::attempt()`: Attempt to log in a user.
    - `Auth::user()`: Get the authenticated user.
    - `Auth::check()`: Check if a user is logged in.
    - `Auth::logout()`: Log out the user.

These are just some of the functions available in the core Laravel classes. There are many more functions, and each class serves specific purposes in the framework. To explore the full list of functions and their details, it is recommended to refer to the official Laravel documentation: https://laravel.com/docs. The documentation provides comprehensive information about each class and its associated functions.
